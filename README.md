Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.


## Why to Learn Python?

* Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

* Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

* Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

* Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
